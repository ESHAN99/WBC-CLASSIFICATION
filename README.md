# WBC-CLASSIFICATION

The dataset is composed of a total of 10,299 images which are organized into the five elements: basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes which were obtained by using the analyser CellaVision DM96 in the Core Laboratory at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The image size used is 360 x 363 pixels, JPG format, and was illustrated by experienced clinical pathologists. The captured images were from uninfected individuals, haematologic or oncologic disease, and free of any pharmacologic treatment during blood collection.

The task of the proposed work is to classify the five cells of WBCâ€™s i.e., neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. To achieve the highest classification accuracy, pretrained model such as  MobileNetV2 is used. The model is executed using TensorFlow/Keras respectively.
